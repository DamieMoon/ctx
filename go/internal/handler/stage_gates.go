// lives in the probe test (mcp_store_gatechain_integration_test.go), which
// restores it through t.Cleanup.
//
// It exists for the same reason handleBlobManage takes its action table as a
// parameter (blob.go:294-300): a surface that copies the seven gates by hand
// and a surface that CALLS this function answer the same bytes for every one of
// them, so no assertion over those seven can tell the two wirings apart. A
// probe gate hung here can: it reaches REST, MCP-direct and MCP-staged if and
// only if all three really run this chain — which is what keeps the claim of
// the doc comment below ("a gate added here reaches every call site at once")
// checkable after the fact instead of merely stated. Three arms, not four: the
// probe drives the surfaces a client can compare byte-for-byte; the chain's
// fourth call site is named below.
//
// A gate sees the REQUEST and nothing else: not the resolved sensitivity, not
// the post-detector metadata, not the resolved scope. That is deliberate — the
// seam can neither reorder nor overturn a verdict of the seven, and it is
// useless as a place to grow production logic.

// a staged write intent, in the same order (D1-M2 complete): required fields →
// size limits → sensitivity resolution → explicit-type validation → G40
// credentials detector → scope gate → write rate limit. It reuses the exact
// direct-path building blocks (blockSizeLimit, storeSensitivity,
// validateTypeNameAgainstSet, applyWriteDetector, writableBlockScopes,
// store.CheckRateLimit) so stage and execute can never diverge.
//
// It started as the STAGED path's copy of that order, while the direct MCP
// store arm still ran a hand-rolled subset. Gap-C6-a removed the split: the
// direct arm (mcpStoreHandler) calls THIS function too, so REST, MCP-direct
// and MCP-staged share one gate order and one set of rejection messages.
//
// FOUR call sites reach it, and a gate added here reaches every call site at
// once: REST /api/store (context_store.go), the MCP store tool for BOTH its arms
// (mcp.go), the confirm of a staged card (mcp_confirm.go) and the chat stage
// runner (chat_stage.go) — five surfaces on four call sites. The doc comments
// of this chain counted three of them until NZ-3 point 9, because the wiring
// probe drives three; the chat arm was the uncounted fourth caller (T02-11
// Übergabe 5). What is true of it is that it reaches the chain with no scope,
// type or sensitivity input of its own (chat_stage.go), so every gate that reads
// one of those fields is inert there — inert, not absent.
//
// pool is only touched when rateLimitWrite > 0 (nil pool + limit 0 is a valid
// test wiring). set == nil fails closed on an explicit type (never lets an
// unvalidated name reach the manual-provenance write path).
//
// Gap-C6-c: every verdict is built from a rejectClass (errcode.go), so it
// carries the same machine code the REST write handlers emit for that class.

// answer.
//
// Three refusals, in this order (the third since C2-8):
//
//  1. I7/S1 (design D-01 §4.3.1, §5.2 B14): a type of the DERIVED layer is
//     never client-claimable. It is checked FIRST, before the registry is even
//     consulted, and that order is load-bearing: the check hangs on
//     derived.StratumOf — a compiled-in string mapping — while the registry is
//     a table, and type_name carries no FK (bruchpfad B15, registry.go
//     sweepOrphans only warns). If the row is dropped or renamed, S1 must still
//     refuse the name. Claiming a derived type buys type_source='manual'
//     (the classifier never touches the block again), guard.check=false,
//     guard.candidate=false, untrusted=false and the optics of a proven
//     derivative — none of which a client may hand itself.
//
//  2. the registry membership check (WF T10), fail-closed on a nil set: an
//     unvalidated name must never reach the manual-provenance write path
//     (§5.1(b)).
//
//  3. BA14/C2-8 (design D-02 §3.1, §5.1 BA14): the resolved policy's
//     write.internal_only. Same verdict CLASS as (1) — 422 reserved_type — and
//     that is deliberate: the two checks answer the same question ("is this
//     type the client's to claim?") from two authorities, and splitting the
//     code would ask a client to branch on WHICH authority refused, a
//     distinction with no consequence on its side. Only the message differs,
//     which is exactly what rejectClass.reject is for.
//
//     It runs AFTER the membership check, not before, and that order is what
//     makes it fail-closed without a fail-open predicate: an unknown name is
//     already gone at (2), so the policy read below is always a policy that
//     actually resolved. Reading a not-ok Resolve here would hand back the zero
//     Policy — write.internal_only=false — and answer "claimable" for a name the
//     registry never heard of.
//
//     (1) still stands in front of it and is not redundant: the derived name
//     list is compiled in, so it refuses insight/catalog even when the registry
//     row is dropped, renamed or served from a degraded snapshot (bruchpfad
//     B15) — the state in which the row-carried flag below is exactly what is
//     missing.

// parentRequiredReject is the fourth claim gate: a type whose registry policy
// says parent.mode=required may not be claimed by a write that carries no
// parent. nil = admissible.
//
// It is the MECHANISM behind a policy that had none (design/02 §8 E02-4).
// blocktype.Set.ParentMode resolved the value and no production path read it,
// so a registry row could promise orphan prevention that no write delivered:
// REST /api/store, both MCP store arms, manage-update and the confirm of a
// staged card all take a client-named `type` out of the same client JSON. A
// block of a required-parent type written through one of them without a parent
// is an orphan by construction — while the registry had accepted the very
// configuration that forbids it. On the shipped registry the affected type is
// `comment`, which is not write.internal_only: `{"type":"comment"}` on
// /api/store bought a comment block with parent_id NULL.
//
// parentID is what THIS WRITE carries, not what the row has — empty means "this
// write names no parent". Since NZ-3 exactly one surface can fill it:
// storeRequest.parent_id on REST /api/store, which hands the id to
// store.PutBlockParent after the upsert (context_store.go). There the gate is a
// CONDITION; everywhere else it stays the total refusal T02-11 built, because
// those shapes carry no parent field at all and pass "" for that reason. The
// other three callers of claimReject — the chat stage runner, /api/ingest and
// the MCP update tool — pass no type either, so the gate is inert on them by
// construction rather than by omission, exactly as validateTypeNameAgainstSet
// already is.
//
// The refusal names the type's own DOMAIN path, and that is not the same offer
// as parent_id: for `comment` the domain path is store.InsertCommentBlock behind
// the issue verbs (manage issue-comment-create, POST
// /api/project/{id}/issues/{block_id}/comments, the MCP issue_comment tool),
// which takes parent_id as a mandatory argument, derives title, local sequence
// and scope FROM the parent, and refuses an empty parent itself
// (store.ErrCommentParentRequired). /api/store with parent_id hangs a block
// under a parent; it does not become that domain path. That path runs neither
// this gate nor this chain and is unchanged, down to the bytes of its first
// refusal.
//
// WHY IN claimReject AND NOT IN runStageWriteGates: the claim gates are the
// surfaces' shared answer to "what may a client assert about a block it writes",
// and manage-update asserts a type from the same JSON without being able to set
// a parent either. Hanging the gate on the store chain alone would have made
// orphan prevention a property of the VERB a client picks — the exact failure
// updateClaimReject (context_manage.go) was written to close. It also inherits
// the confirm-time re-check (confirm_core.go): a card staged before the gate
// existed is refused at confirm instead of executing under the old rules.
//
// KNOWN CONSEQUENCE, deliberate: manage-update cannot re-assert a
// required-parent type on a block that already HAS a parent either — the gate
// sees the claim, not the row. No legitimate write is lost by that, because no
// manage-update payload can give a block the parent the type demands; the case
// is a no-op re-assertion on an existing comment.
//
// It runs AFTER validateTypeNameAgainstSet, and that order is load-bearing:
// ParentMode falls back to ParentModeNone for names it does not know, so a
// parent gate placed ahead of the membership check would answer "admissible"
// for a typo and hand the verdict to the next gate — and a nil set would reach
// s.policies through a nil receiver. Past the membership check the set is
// non-nil and the name resolved.

	// parent field, "this write surface carries no parent" now reads as "this

// plus the WF T10 registry check) and the parent that type's policy demands
// (T02-11). nil = admissible.
//
// ONE function and ONE order — category, metadata, type, parent — called at the
// same position by every write surface, because the gates only add up to an
// invariant when their order and their verdicts are identical everywhere: a
// surface that ran them in its own order would answer the same payload with a
// different rejection, and that difference is what a probing client measures.
// The claim: REST /api/store, the MCP-direct and MCP-staged chain, the chat
// stage runner, /api/ingest, manage-update, the MCP update tool AND the confirm
// core all reach the invariant through this function; the empty-value
// convention (category "" / type "" / nil metadata = "not part of this write")
// is what lets the by-id update surfaces share it with the creating ones.
//
// It was two gates and two orders until the W01-2a Nachbesserung: the
// manage-update copy checked type before category and answered 422 where
// /api/store answered 403 for the identical payload (review finding #6) — the
// exact property this comment claimed.
//
// parentID follows the same empty-value convention as the other three: "" means

// REST /api/store. Passing it explicitly is what keeps that fact at the call
// site instead of inside the gate.
